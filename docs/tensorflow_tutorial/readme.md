## TensorFlow Tutorial

This tutorial is essentially a duplicate of the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/">official tutorial</a>, with some additional notes. Up to now, there are three sections in total:

1. Get Started
2. MNIST Data - A simple regression model
3. MNIST Data - A deep CNN model

In each section, there is a .ipynb file (IPython Notebook) file which can be either opened directly in GitHub or opened in <b>Jupyter Notebook</b> (recommended). Jupyter Notebook creates an interactive Python session in your browser, which allows you to record all your interactions with the Python kernel as well as your own notes.

To use Jupyter Notebook:

1. <a href="http://jupyter.org/install.html">Install Jupyter Notebook</a>
2. Assume you haven't cloned the `medical-ml/` repository in you machine, run in terminal: <br />`git clone https://github.com/rchardx/medical-ml`
3. Change directory: <br />
`cd medical-ml/docs/tensorflow_tutorial/tf_getstarted` <br />(change `tf_getstarted` to other folder names if you want to open other sections)
4. Start Jupyter Notebook: <br />`jupyter notebook`
5. click the `.ipynb` file to open IPython Notebook

In each section, there is a completed Python file implementing the algorithm of the corresponding tutorial. They can be run diretly, provided that you have installed and configured TensorFlow correctly.
